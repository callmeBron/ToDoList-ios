# ToDoList

This ToDoList application was one of the first apps we were tasked with working in teams and giving ourselves an idea to CoreData.
To do list that uses coredata.

Sthembiso was tasked with working on the catergories and created the basis skeleton for the entire team! He really came in clutch with his deep coding 
understanding which really helped us achieve great points, quite fast! 

Bronwyn was tasked with creating the Dashboard/completion summary ... she took the lead with the design and planning as well as taking on the challenge of 
dealing with lifecycles and layers for animation.
